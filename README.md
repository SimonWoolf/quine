Quines
======

Four programs that print their own source code in different ways.

How to use:
```
ruby quine.rb
```

quine1 and quine2 (an empty file and a syntax error respectively) are admittedly a bit cheeky. The 'proper' quine (which took me by far the longest) is quine4. (notaquine3.rb isn't a quine as it accesses its own source file on disk, which is flat-out cheating).
